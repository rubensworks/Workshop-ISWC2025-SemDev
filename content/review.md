## Review Policy
{:#review}

<!-- If contributions will be peer-reviewed, whether, e.g. open review, double anonymous review, or single anonymous review will be used. -->

All contributions (talks, demos, topics) will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee.
Talks and demos will be reviewed based on the same criteria as the [ISWC resources track](https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/#/calls/resource),
but the tool can be unfinished and not well-established yet.
Discussion topics will be reviewed on relevance and potential for discussion.
To foster continued discussions after the review round with program committee members,
we will follow a fully open review policy through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/){:.mandatory}.
