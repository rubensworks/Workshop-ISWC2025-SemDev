## Review Policy
{:#review}

<!-- If contributions will be peer-reviewed, whether, e.g. open review, double anonymous review, or single anonymous review will be used. -->

All contributions (talks, demos, topics) will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee.
To foster continued discussions after the review round with program committee members,
we will follow a fully open review policy through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/){:.mandatory}.
