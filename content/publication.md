## Publication Policy
{:#publication}

<!-- The plans for preserving the workshopâ€™s outcome, e.g., publication of workshop papers in an online repository like CEUR, invitation of selected papers to a journal special issue, etc. -->

We will publish proceedings of the workshop at [CEUR](https://ceur-ws.org/){:.mandatory}.
This will include the short papers submitted as software talks.
Submissions as software demo and discussion topic will be invited to optionally write a paper of at least five pages (requirement of CEUR) for inclusion in the proceedings.
