## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph technologies have undoubtedly had a tremendous impact on today's world.
While academia and industry are both highly active in this field,
there is often a disconnect between these two worlds.
<!-- Need         -->
As such, there is a need to bring these two worlds together.
<!-- Task         -->
The goal of this workshop is to **provide a bridge between academia and industry in the form of a *developers workshop***.
<!-- Object       -->
In this workshop, we invite developers of both worlds to present and discuss their software.
Furthermore, by bringing people from academia and industry physically together,
this workshop will provide a discussion ground for identifying open problems that are relevant to both sides.
<!-- Findings     -->
Besides putting a spotlight on Semantic Web software,
the workshop aims to pinpoint opportunities for future research and implementations.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
This workshop is the spiritual successor to the highly-popular Developers Workshop
that was organized at ESWC and ISWC between 2015 and 2016.
<!-- Perspectives -->
