## Chairs
{:#chairs}

Name, affiliation, email address, homepage, and short (one paragraph) biography of each chair, explaining the chairâ€™s expertise in the workshop topic and experience in organising relevant events.
We strongly advise having more than one chair, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic, ideally with a mix of both junior and senior researchers. We also strongly advise having a maximum of five workshop organisers.
