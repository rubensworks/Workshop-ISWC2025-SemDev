## Workshop Format
{:#format}

<!-- The intended mix of events, such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, demos, and general discussion (either a tentative tabular schedule or a one paragraph summary).
We welcome workshops with an innovative structure and a diverse programme that attracts various types of contributions and ensures rich interactions. -->

Besides standard projectors, this workshop will require booths or tables for demos in the afternoon.
If possible, these booths/tables should be placed outside of the main workshop room.

This workshop will invite three types of contributions:

1. **Software talk**: Participants can submit a short paper (5-6 pages, or ~2,000 words) they can present and (optionally) demonstrate at the workshop. We encourage hands-on presentations, such as live-coding.
2. **Software demo**: Participants can submit a link to a software repository (that has a README) they can demonstrate at the workshop.
3. **Discussion topic**: Participants can submit an abstract (short paragraph) to propose an interactive discussion topic.

While we allow PDF submissions for short papers, alternative formats are also allowed, including self-hosted HTML pages.
All accepted submissions will be included or linked to from our website.
For authors that would like their submission to be included in the published PDF proceedings,
a PDF meeting the [CEUR](https://ceur-ws.org/) requirements must be provided.

In the morning, we will have an invited talk (from Hannah Bast on the QLever SPARQL engine, pending invitation).
Afterwards, accepted software talks will be presented.
In the afternoon, the workshop will be more focused towards open discussions and interaction.
During this time, accepted software demos will be held in parallel with the accepted discussion topics.
We also plan a panel discussion on the topic of bridging academia and industry.
Depending on the number of discussion topics, we will split the group into breakout sessions.
Each software demos will have a dedicated booth which the workshop participants can visit during or in-between the breakout sessions.
