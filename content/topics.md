<!-- What topics of interest will be covered by the workshop
Proposed workshops should have a core theme that is much more selective than the broader scope of the main conference.
We may reject or propose to merge workshops that overlap significantly with other workshops in terms of theme. -->

The core theme of this workshop concerns **development efforts related to the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, and Linked Data**.
An orthogonal goal is to **connect academia and industry** through these collective development efforts.
Possible contributions include the following:

- Web applications
- Web APIs
- browser extensions
- libraries (client-side or server-side)
- visualizations
- user interfaces
- end-user tools
- development tools
- data or ontology processors
- application development (query engines, processors, reasoners, …)
- implementations of the semantic web standards (including RDF-star and RDF/SPARQL 1.2)
- …
